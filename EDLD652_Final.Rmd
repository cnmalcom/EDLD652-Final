# Description of the data
#### The data used for this project are from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus, a text dataset of approximately 681000 blogposts. For the purposes of this project, we will be working with one tenth of the full dataset. In addition to the text of each blog post, some information about each the post (topic, date posted) and blogger (gender, age, astrological sign) is included.

# Research question 1:
## What are the most frequently used words in all writing samples?

```{r rq1, warning= FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#parsing words from the 'text' column
tidy_words <- data %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
tidy_words

#removing numbers
tidy_words <- tidy_words[-grep("\\b\\d+\\b", tidy_words$word),]

#removing 'nbsp' and 'urlink' - THIS DOESN"T WORK! not sure why currently
#exclu <- tibble(word = c("nbsp","urlinkl"))
#tidy_words <- tidy_words %>% 
#  anti_join(exclu, by = "word")
#head(tidy_words)

#counting most frequently occurring words, removing stop words from counts
tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

#plot
tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% # make y-axis ordered by n
  slice(1:15) %>% # select only the first 15 rows
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +

    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "gray80")
  ) +

    x = "Word Frequency",
    y = "Word",
    title = "Top 15 most frequently occurring words across all blog posts",
    caption = "Data abbreviated from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus"
  )
```
# Research question 2:
## 

```{r rq2, warning= FALSE, echo = FALSE}

```





# Research question 3:
## Is there a relationship between blog post length and date posted? 
## OR: How does frequency of use of the word "??" differ depending on ??

```{r q3}

```
